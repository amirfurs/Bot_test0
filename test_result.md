# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "Successfully implemented complete Discord bot 'المنظِّم الذكي – SmartModerator' with all requested features. Bot is connected and running (online status, 9 guilds, 13 users). Backend includes full Discord API integration, database models, and REST API. Frontend has comprehensive bilingual dashboard. Ready for comprehensive testing."

    message: "Completed backend testing. Discord bot is online and connected to 9 guilds with 13 users. Basic API endpoints (/api/bot/status and /api/bot/guilds) are working correctly. However, all database-related endpoints are returning 500 Internal Server Error due to MongoDB ObjectId serialization issues. The error in logs shows: 'TypeError: ObjectId object is not iterable' and 'TypeError: vars() argument must have __dict__ attribute'. This needs to be fixed before the database-related endpoints can be used. 
    
    SOLUTION: To fix the MongoDB ObjectId serialization issue, you need to:
    1. Create a custom PyObjectId class that handles serialization
    2. Update your Pydantic models to use this class
    3. Configure the models to properly serialize ObjectId to string
    
    Example implementation:
    ```python
    from bson import ObjectId
    
    class PyObjectId(ObjectId):
        @classmethod
        def __get_validators__(cls):
            yield cls.validate
    
        @classmethod
        def validate(cls, v):
            if not ObjectId.is_valid(v):
                raise ValueError('Invalid ObjectId')
            return ObjectId(v)
    
        @classmethod
        def __modify_schema__(cls, field_schema):
            field_schema.update(type='string')
    
    # Then update your Pydantic models:
    class YourModel(BaseModel):
        id: PyObjectId = Field(default_factory=PyObjectId, alias='_id')
        # other fields...
    
        class Config:
            allow_population_by_field_name = True
            arbitrary_types_allowed = True
            json_encoders = {
                ObjectId: str
            }
    ```"
  - agent: "main"
    message: "Fixed MongoDB ObjectId serialization issue by implementing proper JSON encoding with jsonable_encoder from FastAPI and updating all Pydantic models to use string IDs. Also fixed Pydantic v2 compatibility warnings. All database operations and API endpoints should now work correctly. Bot is successfully connected and running with environment variables configured. Ready to test REST API endpoints and then proceed with frontend interface improvements as requested by user."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Successfully tested all backend API endpoints. The Discord bot is online and connected to 9 guilds with 12 users. All endpoints are now working correctly, including the database-related endpoints that were previously failing with 500 errors.

    Fixed two main issues:
    1. MongoDB ObjectId serialization - Resolved by properly converting ObjectId to string in API responses
    2. Event loop conflicts - Fixed by creating separate MongoDB clients for API endpoints and Discord bot to prevent 'Task got Future attached to a different loop' errors

    All the following endpoints are now working correctly:
    - /api/bot/status - Returns bot status, guild count, user count, and latency
    - /api/bot/guilds - Returns list of all guilds the bot is in
    - /api/bot/settings/{guild_id} - Returns and updates bot settings for a specific guild
    - /api/bot/stats/{guild_id} - Returns statistics for a specific guild
    - /api/bot/members/{guild_id} - Returns members for a specific guild
    - /api/bot/strikes/{guild_id} - Returns strikes for a specific guild
    - /api/bot/actions/{guild_id} - Returns moderation actions for a specific guild

    The backend is now ready for frontend integration."
